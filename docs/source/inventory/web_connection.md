# WebSSH Connection
WebSSH provides terminal access to a device where eNMS establishes 
a Telnet or SSH session to the device using the information stored in the
network inventory.  There are multiple ways to establish a WebSSH connection.


## From Devices Inventory Table

You can connect to a device by clicking on the `Connect` button of a device
entry in the `Inventory / Devices` table as shown below.

The following dialog will appear:

![Connection window](../_static/inventory/web_connection/connection_parameters.png)

You can configure the following parameters:

- `Property used for the connection`: This dropdown list is used to select one
of the following options:
	- `IP address`: This is the IP address stored in inventory for the device.
	- `Name`: This is the name property of the selected device.
	- `Console 1`: The value stored in the Console 1 property for the device.
	- `Console 2`: The value stored in the Console 2 property for the device.
- `Automatically authenticate`: (SSH only) eNMS uses the credentials stored
in the Vault (production mode) or the database (test mode) to automatically
authenticate to the network device. By default, `device credentials` are
selected but `user credentials` or `custom credentials` options are also available.
Custom credentials are specified in the connection dialog directly.
- `Protocol`: `SSH` or `Telnet`.

When the session parameters are configured as desired, click the `Web Session`
button to connect to the device.

## From Network Views

Connections can also be initiated to a device from views 
`Visualization / Geographical View` or `Visualization / Logical View`.
Right-click on any device and select `Connect`.  The same dialog detailed
above is used to complete the connection process.
