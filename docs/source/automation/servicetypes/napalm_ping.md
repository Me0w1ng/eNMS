ping to a designated target. The output contains ping round trip time
statistics.

- `Count`: Number of ping packets to send.
- `Size` Size of the ping packet payload to send in bytes.
- `Source IP address` Override the source ip address of the ping
  packet with this provided IP.
- `Timeout` Seconds to wait before declaring timeout.
- `Ttl` Time to Live parameter, which tells routers when to discard
  this packet because it has been in the network too long (too many
  hops).
