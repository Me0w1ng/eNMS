      <b>Logging</b> controls what is printed to the log file when a service is being
        run. This is helpful to uncover a suppressed error by seeing all possible log
        statements using <b>debug</b>. It can also reduce the size of the log file by
        <b> Disable logging</b>. The order of verbosity is as follows:
        <b>Disable logging</b>, <b>critical</b>, <b>error</b>, <b>warning</b>,
        <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>.
