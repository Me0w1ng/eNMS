      When the user sets <b>Number of retries</b> to non-zero, the service will run
      again if the result ends in a <b>Failure</b>. And, if the result continues to fail,
      the service will try again up to this <b>Number of retries</b>.

      Tip: Retries can work along with the <b>Validation</b> section of <b>Step 4</b> to
      create an active polling loop for this service. For example, imagine the case where
      running a slow asynchronous commandX on a device, the device raises an alarm
      until commandX completes.  Once commandX does complete, the alarm clears.  If the
      workflow should pause execution until commandX is complete, this can be
      accomplished with 2 services: a) service 1 issues commandX, b) service 2
      issues a command to show alarms -and- <b>Step 4</b> <b>Validation</b> set to
      text match the Alarm Text -and- with <b>Negative Logic</b> enabled -and-
      <b>Number of retries</b> set to a high number.  This will cause service 2 to fail
      and retry showing alarms until the alarm clears, indicating that commandX is complete.
      Then the workflow will continue.
