      <b>Number of retries</b> is used when the service results in a <b>Failure</b>.
      This is useful when a device is processing a routine and the response from the
      device will vary after the device has finished processing that routine. Generally,
      a test is set in <b>Validation</b> of <b>Step 4</b> to determine if the response
      from the device indicates the routine has completed. Note, any failure will
      trigger the retry, such as lack of connectivity to the device.
