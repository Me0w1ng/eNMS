    <b>Type of Credentials</b> allows you to select either <b>Read</b> or
    <b>Run</b> device credentials. This does not override Role Based Access rules,
    however if a user has access to both <b>Read</b> and <b>Run</b>, this allows the
    service author to specify which type of credential to use for a device connection.
