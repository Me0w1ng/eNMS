      <b>Priority</b> allows you to determine the order a service runs when two services
        would otherwise be run at the same time. Formerly this was handled using
        <b>Prerequisite Edges</b>. The typical use case is when a service has two edges
        exiting from the right side and both edges are the same type. In this case you
        may determine the order of the service execution using <b>Priority</b>. The lower
        number gets run first.
