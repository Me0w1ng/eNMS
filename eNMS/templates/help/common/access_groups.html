      <b>Groups</b> is a comma separated list of arbitrary names available for
      matching pools.  RBAC manages collections of services using pools.
      Service membership in a pool is based on filters available for many
      properties of a service.
    <p/>
    <p>
      When a user creates a service, that user's <b>Groups</b> supply the
      default <b>Groups</b> assigned to the service; meaning users in their
      group also get access.
